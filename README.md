This is my very first application about machine learning.
Aim:-To predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.
The history of RMS titanic can be found in the link below.

1.Data 
2.Data Preprocessing
3.Data Analysis
4.Train-test split
5.Logistic Regression
6.Evaluation
